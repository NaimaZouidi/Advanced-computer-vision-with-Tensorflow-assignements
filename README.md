# Advanced-computer-vision-with-Tensorflow-assignements

This repository contain my answers to the Advanced computer vision assignements with Tensorflow in Coursera.
In this course we explored image segmentation, object localization, and well as object detection. We also:

1) Applied object detection models such as regional-CNN and ResNet-50, customize existing models, and build our own models to detect, localize, and label rubber duck images.
2) Implemented image segmentation using variations of the fully convolutional network (FCN) including U-Net and Mask-RCNN to identify and detect numbers, pets, zombies, and more.
3) Identified which parts of an image are being used by our model to make its predictions using class activation maps and saliency maps and apply these ML interpretation methods to inspect and improve the design of a well know neural network, so-called AlexNet.
